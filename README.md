## Introduction
Due to increasing international exchange students in Korea, we decided to find the best place for international students dormitory in Seoul. 

## EDA
EDA1: correlation between the financial soundness of domestic universities and the number of foreign students<br/>
EDA2: Visualization of average lease price in Seoul<br/>
EDA3: Number of international students for each location<br/>
EDA4: Budget magnitude of ‘Gu’. <br/>
EDA5: Number of international students from each continent<br/>
EDA6: Correlation between house price and other features<br/>
EDA7: Data analysis in the location Part

## Project
We have defined 3 major problems that need to be solved. Based on EDA analysis and bibliography, we have considered the best solutions for each problem. <br/>
(1) How can we convince the presidents of the universities?<br/>
By bibliography about economic effects of international students, we can persuade presidents of universities and the city of Seoul saying that international students can give them economic benefits. According to the bibliography, the economic income from attracting international students reaches about 800 billion won. The university’s economic income of attracting one international student is three times of attracting one graduate student. We could also find news articles that foreign students filled up the college financial difficulties. <br/>
(2) How can we choose the best location for international students dormitory?<br/>
Considering rent price, number of international students, budget magnitude, crime rates, and cultural richness with different weights for each category, we decided to build the international student dormitory in Seongbuk-gu.<br/>
(3) How can we justify the financial investment between the city of Seoul and the universities?<br/>
To calculate the cost for the international student dormitory, we referred to the existing international student accommodation in Korea, Nuri-hall. Considering the land cost and construction cost, we could calculate the total cost needed to build the accommodation. Based on bibliography, we decided to get the financial investment by communities, city of Seoul, and universities of Seoul.
